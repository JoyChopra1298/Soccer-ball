# Soccer-ball
This is a project that I have done as a part of competition held by Robotics Club IITG 
In this project we had to make a robot playing soccer ball using computer vision.A camera is fixed at the ceiling and the live video is the input.Using computer vision techniquues we had to identify our soccer bot , opponent bot, both the goal ilnes and the ball. After this the objective is to kick the ball the to the opponent goal when the ball comes in our half of the arena and defend our goal when the ball goes to the opponent goal.
